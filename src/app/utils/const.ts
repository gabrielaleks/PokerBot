### [Summary] Thinking Poker Daily Episode 3 -  Andrew and Carlos face a river raise

- **Hosts:** Nate and Carlos
- **Listener Question:** Jim asks about a hand he played in a low-stakes tournament, seeking to identify leaks in his play.
- **Game Details:**
  - Blind level: 50-100
  - Hero's stack: 12,000 (120 big blinds)
  - Villains' stacks: All covered Hero

- **Hand Breakdown:**
  - **Pre-flop:** 
    - Hero limps in the small blind with King Jack offsuit.
    - Big blind checks; four players see the flop.
  
  - **Flop:** 
    - Flop comes Ace, Queen, Ten (Rainbow).
    - Hero flops the nuts and bets 165.
    - Villain raises to 800; one player calls.
    - Hero re-raises to 1700; both players call.
  
  - **Turn:** 
    - Turn is a five (Ace-Queen-Ten-Five).
    - Hero bets about 75% of the pot; both players call.

  - **River:** 
    - River is an Ace, making it a dangerous card for Hero.
    - Hero shoves for roughly two-thirds of the pot.

- **Discussion Points:**
  - **Pre-flop Play:**
    - Carlos expresses caution about playing King Jack offsuit out of position.
    - Nate counters that if players wonâ€™t fold, raising might be a better option.
  
  - **Flop Betting:**
    - Carlos believes Hero's flop bet is too small; recommends betting larger to build the pot.
  
  - **Turn Betting:**
    - Both agree that the turn bet is appropriate, though Carlos would consider betting slightly larger.
  
  - **River Play:**
    - Nate supports the river shove, emphasizing that low-stakes opponents often call with weaker hands.
    - Carlos agrees, stating that Hero should expect opponents to call with worse hands.

- **Final Thoughts:**
  - Nate advises against checking the river with the intent to fold, suggesting that Jim's bet was justified despite being drawn out on.
  - They conclude that Jim should focus on pre-flop and flop plays to improve his overall strategy.

- **Closing:** 
  - Nate thanks Jim for his question, encouraging thoughtful reflection on poker hands.
